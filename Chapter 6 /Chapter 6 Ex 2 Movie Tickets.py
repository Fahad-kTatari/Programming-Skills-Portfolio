Chapter 6 Ex 2 Movie Tickets
A movie theater charges different ticket prices depending on a personâ€™s age. If a person is under the age of 3, the ticket is free; if

they are between 3 and 12, the ticket is $10; and if they are over age 12, the ticket is $15. Write a loop in which you ask users their

age, and then tell them the cost of their movie ticket

    age = input("Please enter your age (or 'quit' to exit): ")
    
    if age.lower() == 'quit':
        break
